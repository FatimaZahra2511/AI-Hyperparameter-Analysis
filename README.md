# AI-Hyperparameter-Analysis
This project explores hyperparameter tuning in AI models.
Overview

This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is trained with different hyperparameters and network architectures to evaluate their impact on classification performance.
